<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>What is this?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This is an app that helps you calculate and choose the best (optimal) tank size for your rainwater harvesting system (according to your location).</li>
	  <li>This app will not design your entire rainwater harvesting system. You need a contractor for that. Your contractor will design the system based on the tank size you choose from this app.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What size should I choose?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>In practice, it depends on the space you can make available for the tank in your property, or the cost of the tank.</li>
      <li>In theory, you can put the smallest size possible (minimum) and largest size possible (maximum) in the input for comparison.</li>
      <li>You must also specify the size in between (interval), which means how much bigger do you want the tank size to get, gradually, before reaching the maximum size.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Why do I need to choose rainfall data?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You need rainfall data to determine how much rainwater you can receive for your rainwater harvesting system. You will need to choose rainfall station which is closest to your property to be able to get more accurate calculation of the rainwater you can receive, since rainfall amount differ by location/region.</li>
      <li>You can also load your own daily rainfall data in csv. The csv file must have 2 columns, with headers titled &lsquo;<strong>Date</strong>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<strong>Depth</strong>&rsquo; respectively. The &lsquo;Date&rsquo; must be in 28/01/2003 (dd/mm/yyyy) format, while the depth (daily rainfall value) is in mm. Please remove all symbols (eg. ?, *, # ) in the csv. Please make sure your rainfall data is cleaned and <strong>complete</strong> for every year, as the calculation assumes complete data for each year. Incomplete year will not be included in the analysis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Why can&rsquo;t I find any rainfall station at my place?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If you cannot find any rainfall station at your location, please zoom out and look for the nearest station. Rainfall stations included in this app were selected from stations with data for at least 10 years.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>How to measure my roof area?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Your roof area should be the area which can collect the rainwater and channel it to your tank. If you are unable to measure it on site, try to look up your property on Google Earth and use the measuring tool. If your property is not viewable on Google Earth, you will have to measure it on the ground.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>What is "roof coefficient"?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Roof coefficient depends on the material the roof is made out of. It basically means the percentage of rainwater that can be collected by the roof, depending on the material.</li>
      <li>For reference, the roof coefficient for most common material is listed as follows: 0.8 for concrete roof, 0.9 for zink/metal roof, or other value less than 1 (you can input other custom value)</li>
	  <li>Please note that losses such as evaporation and leaks are considered minimal and therefore are not taken into account.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>What is "first flush"?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>First flush means the amount of rainwater that should be flushed away when a rain event starts. This will be able to wash away some dirt from the roof to enable us to collect relatively cleaner water for our rainwater harvesting system.</li>
      <li>The most common value used is 1 mm. However, you can also use other values. Total first flush volume equals to the selected value multiplied by roof area.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>What is "Potential amount of harvested rainwater to be used per day (litres)"?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This is the amount of rainwater you plan to use for your toilet flushing, car washing, general cleaning etc from the rainwater harvesting system. In other words, the amount of rainwater you intend to use.</li>
      <li>Note that it is a daily amount, assuming that weekdays and weekends water demand are similar.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>What does the results mean?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Water-saving efficiency means the percentage of water demand that can be met by the rainwater harvesting system.</li>
      <li>Bear in mind that once the curve for water-saving efficiency gradually flattens, the increasing tank sizes will not increase the amount of water used in the rainwater harvesting system by much. Which means your optimal tank size is before the flattening of the curve.</li>
	  <li>Conventionally, 75% is the minimum required water-saving efficiency for rainwater harvesting system.</li>
	  <li>Storage efficiency means the percentage of rainwater which is used in your rainwater harvesting system and is not lost to overflow.</li>
      <li>If the storage efficiency is low, it means that a large percentage of the rainwater your roof can collect goes down the drain, literally. If you would like to increase the storage efficiency, you can try any or combination of these methods:
	  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal; padding-bottom: 0;">
		<li style="margin-left:0.5em">Increase tank size to increase storage volume</li>
		<li style="margin-left:0.5em; padding-bottom: 0;">Increase water demand (amount of rainwater to be used)</li>
		</ol>
	  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>What does Tank Volume Percentage Time chart mean?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This chart shows the percentage of time the tank is at certain volume.</li>
      <li>Tank volume is divided into 5 classes. Y-axis is the percentage time the tank is at different classes of volume.</li>
      <li>Eg. the more inefficient the tank size is, the more time it is at empty (red).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
