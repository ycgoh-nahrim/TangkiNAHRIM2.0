R script for Tangki NAHRIM 2.0
  
  <ul>
  <li>Tangki NAHRIM is used for calculating optimal rainwater harvesting tank size in Malaysia.</li>

<li>Tangki NAHRIM 2.0 (TN2) is the upgraded version.</li>

<li>TN2 was developed in the R computing environment and is available as a Shiny web application.</li>

<li>TN2 uses a daily water balance model which adopts the yield-after-spill (YAS) convention.</li>

<li>The proposed tank sizes are evaluated according to water-saving and storage efficiencies.</li>
</ul>
